This Script replaces the Gamemode Spawn function! Feel Free to use!

# Installation
put the sp-config.lua and sp-server.lua into your server\GarrysMod\garrysmod\lua folder! then just write into the Server console "lua_openscript sp-server.lua" you can also put this into your Start config 

# What you need / requirements
You REALLY NEED ULX. What is ULX?! ULX is a Rank System for your Server with permissions for each Playergroup! So you can control your Server easily! To start ULX you need ULib!

# Why do you need ULX for this Script?!
It's simple. To be honest you can use EVERY Playergroup tool for Gmod. You need a Playergroup tool for the Tables:

HP:

	local rankshp = {
		["superadmin"] = 999,
		["user"] = 100,
		["premium"] = 500
	}

Weapons:

	local rankswp = {
		["superadmin"] = "weapon_physgun",
		["user"] = "weapon_crowbar",
		["premium"] = "weapon_crowbar"
	}
  
Armor:

	local ranksarm = {
		["superadmin"] = 1000,
		["user"] = 100,
		["premium"] = 250
	}

If you don't have ULX on the Server and not the Groups that are in this Script it won't will work rightly! Write me on Steam if you have more questions!
